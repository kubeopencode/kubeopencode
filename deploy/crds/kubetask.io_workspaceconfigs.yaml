          WorkspaceConfig defines the workspace environment for task execution.
          Workspace = AI agent + permissions + tools + infrastructure
          This is the execution black box - Batch creators don't need to understand execution details.

              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and

              Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents.

                description: |-
                  DefaultContexts defines the base-level contexts that are included in all tasks
                  using this WorkspaceConfig. These contexts are applied at the lowest priority,
                  meaning Batch commonContext and variableContexts take precedence.

                  Context priority (lowest to highest):
                    1. WorkspaceConfig.defaultContexts (base layer)
                    2. Batch.commonContext (shared across all tasks in the batch)
                    3. Batch.variableContexts[i] (task-specific contexts)

                  Use this for organization-wide defaults like coding standards, security policies,
                  or common tool configurations that should apply to all tasks.
