    # Rules for AI Agent

      ## Working Directory Structure (IMPORTANT)

      Understanding the directory structure is critical for successful task execution:

      - `${WORKSPACE_DIR}` = `/workspace` (Agent's base directory, set by KubeTask)
      - Git repositories are cloned to `${WORKSPACE_DIR}/<mountPath>`
        - Example: Task with `mountPath: kubetask` → repo at `/workspace/kubetask`
      - GitHub scripts are at `${WORKSPACE_DIR}/.github-app/`
      - **Always `cd` into the Git repo directory before any git operations**

      ```bash
      # Example: Working with a cloned repo
      cd ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/kubetask  # or your repo's mountPath from Task spec
      git status
      git checkout -b my-branch
      ```

      ## Task Scope

      - If the task content is unrelated to the KubeTask project, DO NOT execute it
      - Only perform tasks that are relevant to the KubeTask project (e.g., development, testing, operations, research, analysis, troubleshooting, discussion)

      ## Safety First

      - If a task has potential risk of damaging the system, DO NOT execute it
      - When in doubt about safety implications, refuse to proceed and explain why

      ## Git Commit Standards

      - All commits must be signed: `git commit -s -m "your commit message"`
      - Check the default branch (main or master) before creating PRs

      ## Git Branch Naming (IMPORTANT)

      When creating a new branch, **always append a random suffix** to avoid conflicts with existing branches:

      ```bash
      # Generate a random suffix (6 chars)
      SUFFIX=$(head -c 6 /dev/urandom | base64 | tr -dc 'a-z0-9' | head -c 6)
      BRANCH_NAME="feature-name-${SUFFIX}"
      git checkout -b "${BRANCH_NAME}"
      ```

      **Example**: Instead of `add-owners-file`, use `add-owners-file-a3b2c1`

      ## Git Remote Verification (CRITICAL)

      Before any git push or PR creation, you MUST verify the correct repository:

      - **Always run `git remote -v`** to check the actual remote URL
      - **Extract org/repo from remote URL**, do NOT infer from task description or directory name
      - **Example**: If remote shows `https://github.com/kubetask-io/kubetask.git`, use `kubetask-io/kubetask` (not `kubetask/kubetask`)

      ## Non-Interactive Commands (CRITICAL)

      Since tasks run autonomously in the background, you MUST use non-interactive command forms:

      - **Git push**: Always use `git push https://x-access-token:${GH_TOKEN}@github.com/<org>/<repo>.git <branch>` instead of `git push origin <branch>`
        - Get `<org>/<repo>` from `git remote -v` output, NOT from assumptions
        - **IMPORTANT**: Use `x-access-token` as username for GitHub App tokens
      - **Git clone**: Use `git clone https://x-access-token:${GH_TOKEN}@github.com/<org>/<repo>.git` for private repos
      - **Git remote**: Set remote URL with token: `git remote set-url origin https://x-access-token:${GH_TOKEN}@github.com/<org>/<repo>.git`
      - **Never** use commands that prompt for username/password
      - **Never** use interactive flags like `-i` or `--interactive`
      - **Always** use `--no-edit` flag when applicable (e.g., `git merge --no-edit`)
      - **Always** use `-y` or `--yes` flags for package managers (e.g., `apt-get -y install`)

      ## Code and Documentation Standards

      - Code must be written in English
      - Comments must be written in English
      - Commit messages must be written in English
      - PR descriptions must be written in English

      ## Temporary Files

      **Do NOT use `/tmp` directory** - some AI agents have sandbox restrictions that prevent reading files outside the workspace.

      Create temporary files **WITHIN the Git repository directory** (not in `${WORKSPACE_DIR}` root):

      ```bash
      # Correct: Create temp files inside the Git repo
      cd ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/kubetask  # Your repo's mountPath
      mkdir -p .tmp
      echo "some-value" > .tmp/my-temp-file
      # Later read: cat .tmp/my-temp-file

      # Wrong: Creating temp files in workspace root
      # echo "value" > ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/branch_name  # May cause path confusion!
      ```

      **Why inside the Git repo?** The Agent typically operates within the repo directory. Files created at `${WORKSPACE_DIR}/` level may be inaccessible when working inside a subdirectory.
