        # Rules for AI Agent

          ## Working Directory Structure (IMPORTANT)

          Understanding the directory structure is critical for successful task execution:

          - `${WORKSPACE_DIR}` = `/workspace` (Agent's base directory, set by KubeTask)
          - Git repositories are cloned to `${WORKSPACE_DIR}/<mountPath>`
            - Example: Task with `mountPath: kubetask` → repo at `/workspace/kubetask`
          - GitHub scripts are at `${WORKSPACE_DIR}/.github-app/`
          - **Always `cd` into the Git repo directory before any git operations**

          ```bash
          # Example: Working with a cloned repo
          cd ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/kubetask  # or your repo's mountPath from Task spec
          git status
          git checkout -b my-branch
          ```

          ## Task Scope

          - If the task content is unrelated to the KubeTask project, DO NOT execute it
          - Only perform tasks that are relevant to the KubeTask project (e.g., development, testing, operations, research, analysis, troubleshooting, discussion)

          ## Safety First

          - If a task has potential risk of damaging the system, DO NOT execute it
          - When in doubt about safety implications, refuse to proceed and explain why

          ## Git Commit Standards

          - All commits must be signed: `git commit -s -m "your commit message"`
          - Check the default branch (main or master) before creating PRs

          ## Git Branch Naming (IMPORTANT)

          When creating a new branch, **always append a random suffix** to avoid conflicts with existing branches:

          ```bash
          # Generate a random suffix (6 chars)
          SUFFIX=$(head -c 6 /dev/urandom | base64 | tr -dc 'a-z0-9' | head -c 6)
          BRANCH_NAME="feature-name-${SUFFIX}"
          git checkout -b "${BRANCH_NAME}"
          ```

          **Example**: Instead of `add-owners-file`, use `add-owners-file-a3b2c1`

          ## Git Remote Verification (CRITICAL)

          Before any git push or PR creation, you MUST verify the correct repository:

          - **Always run `git remote -v`** to check the actual remote URL
          - **Extract org/repo from remote URL**, do NOT infer from task description or directory name
          - **Example**: If remote shows `https://github.com/kubetask-io/kubetask.git`, use `kubetask-io/kubetask` (not `kubetask/kubetask`)

          ## Non-Interactive Commands (CRITICAL)

          Since tasks run autonomously in the background, you MUST use non-interactive command forms:

          - **Git push**: Always use `git push https://x-access-token:${GH_TOKEN}@github.com/<org>/<repo>.git <branch>` instead of `git push origin <branch>`
            - Get `<org>/<repo>` from `git remote -v` output, NOT from assumptions
            - **IMPORTANT**: Use `x-access-token` as username for GitHub App tokens
          - **Git clone**: Use `git clone https://x-access-token:${GH_TOKEN}@github.com/<org>/<repo>.git` for private repos
          - **Git remote**: Set remote URL with token: `git remote set-url origin https://x-access-token:${GH_TOKEN}@github.com/<org>/<repo>.git`
          - **Never** use commands that prompt for username/password
          - **Never** use interactive flags like `-i` or `--interactive`
          - **Always** use `--no-edit` flag when applicable (e.g., `git merge --no-edit`)
          - **Always** use `-y` or `--yes` flags for package managers (e.g., `apt-get -y install`)

          ## Code and Documentation Standards

          - Code must be written in English
          - Comments must be written in English
          - Commit messages must be written in English
          - PR descriptions must be written in English

          ## Temporary Files

          **Do NOT use `/tmp` directory** - some AI agents have sandbox restrictions that prevent reading files outside the workspace.

          Create temporary files **WITHIN the Git repository directory** (not in `${WORKSPACE_DIR}` root):

          ```bash
          # Correct: Create temp files inside the Git repo
          cd ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/kubetask  # Your repo's mountPath
          mkdir -p .tmp
          echo "some-value" > .tmp/my-temp-file
          # Later read: cat .tmp/my-temp-file

          # Wrong: Creating temp files in workspace root
          # echo "value" > ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/branch_name  # May cause path confusion!
          ```

          **Why inside the Git repo?** The Agent typically operates within the repo directory. Files created at `${WORKSPACE_DIR}/` level may be inaccessible when working inside a subdirectory.

        # GitHub Operations

        ## Quick Reference

        Two scripts are available at `${WORKSPACE_DIR}/.github-app/`:

        | Script | Purpose |
        |--------|---------|
        | `github.sh` | High-level operations (push, PR) - **use this for common tasks** |
        | `github-app-iat.sh` | Generate token for custom `gh` commands |

        ## Common Tasks (Recommended)

        **Note**: Use `bash` to execute scripts (avoids permission issues):

        ### Push and Create PR (One Command)

        ```bash
        bash ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/.github-app/github.sh push-and-pr <branch> "<title>" "[body]"
        ```

        Example:
        ```bash
        bash ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/.github-app/github.sh push-and-pr feature-branch "feat: add new feature" "Description here"
        ```

        ### Push Only

        ```bash
        bash ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/.github-app/github.sh push <branch>
        ```

        ### Create PR Only (branch must already be pushed)

        ```bash
        bash ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/.github-app/github.sh pr <branch> "<title>" "[body]"
        ```

        ## Custom GitHub Commands

        For commands not covered by `github.sh`, generate a token first:

        ```bash
        export GH_TOKEN=$(bash ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/.github-app/github-app-iat.sh \
          "$(cat /etc/github-app/client_id)" \
          /etc/github-app/private_key \
          "$(cat /etc/github-app/installation_id)")

        # Now use any gh command
        gh issue create --title "Bug report" --body "Description"
        gh pr comment 123 --body "LGTM!"
        gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues
        ```

        **IMPORTANT**: Token generation and usage MUST be in the SAME shell command (connected with `&&`),
        because each tool call runs in a separate shell session.

        ## Troubleshooting

        ### Permission Denied Error

        If you see "Permission denied" when running scripts, fix permissions first:

        ```bash
        chmod +x ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/.github-app/*.sh
        ```

        Or use `bash` prefix (recommended - no permission needed):

        ```bash
        bash ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/.github-app/github.sh push-and-pr ...
        ```

        ### Script Path Issues

        Always use the documented symlink path, not physical paths with timestamps:

        - **Correct**: `${WORKSPACE_DIR}/.github-app/github.sh`
        - **Wrong**: `/workspace/.github-app/..2025_12_21.../github.sh`

        ## Notes

        - Tokens are valid for 1 hour
        - Scripts auto-detect repository from `git remote -v`
        - Credentials are at `/etc/github-app/` (client_id, installation_id, private_key)
        - Never echo or log token values
