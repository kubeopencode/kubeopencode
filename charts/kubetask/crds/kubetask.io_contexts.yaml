          Context represents a reusable context resource for AI agent tasks.
          Context is the top-level API for managing reusable context content that can be
          shared across multiple Tasks and Agents.

          Unlike inline contexts (ContextItem), Context CRs enable:
            - Reusability: Share the same context across multiple Tasks
            - Independent lifecycle: Update context without modifying Tasks
            - Version control: Track context changes in Git
            - Separation of concerns: Context content vs. mount location

          The mount path is NOT defined in Context - it's specified by the referencing
          Task or Agent via ContextMount.mountPath. This allows the same Context to be
          mounted at different paths by different consumers.
